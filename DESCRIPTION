Description: This package calculates "performance points" for various archery rounds using the data from the 
  2016-2018 national archery tournaments hosted by the NFAA and USA Archery. The calculations use a "trimmed" version of 
  the results for each round and equipment class with the top and bottom 10% of scores eliminated. The CDF of the remaining 
  middle 80% are modeled with an exponential or linear fit to derive the final points value. The performance points are suitable for 
  determining an annual "Shooter of the Year" winner for an archery organization.
